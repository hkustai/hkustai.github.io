<h2>Instructor</h2><p><a href="http://www.zstevenwu.com">Steven Wu</a>, Keller 6-225E. Office hour: Monday 9:00 AM -- 10:00 AM.</p>



<h2>Canvas</h2><p>Please sign up
for <a href="https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/73910">the course page on
Canvas</a> and monitor it throughout the term. We will be using Canvas
to post assignments and updates, and to conduct class
discussions. Please post your questions there (you can also post only
for the instructor to see).</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
With the help of computers and mobile devices, companies, researchers 
and government can now easily collect vast amounts of personal data,
including medical records, GPS locations, web-search
logs, and social exchanges. The analysis of such a wide range of data
can reveal important insights that can benefit healthcare, research,
and policy-making, but it also imposes the risk of leaking sensitive
information about the individual citizens. This tension between
utility and privacy motivates us to study the following question in
this course:</p><br>

<p><i>How do we perform useful analysis on a data set that contains
sensitive information about individuals without compromising the
privacy of those individuals?</i></p><br>

<p>To study this question, we will introduce the notion
of <i>differential privacy</i>, which provides a framework of
designing data analysis algorithms with strong, meaningful, and
mathematically provable privacy guarantees. We will survey a set of
algorithmic tools that allow us to privately perform a wide
range of statistical analyses. Of course, privacy does not come for
free, and we will also study some of the fundamental limitations
imposed by the requirement of differential privacy. Through the
discussion of these results, we will also demonstrate some of the most
novel and surprising connections between differential privacy and
other areas of theoretical computer science, including machine
learning theory, cryptography, convex geometry, and game theory.
</p>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>This is a theory-oriented course, intended for graduate students
and advanced undergraduates. The (informal) prerequisites are
mathematical maturity, ability to read and engage with original
research, and familiarity with probability and introductory
algorithms. Prior coursework in algorithms, computational complexity,
machine learning, and probability will be helpful.</p>

<h2> Textbooks </h2> Most of the course will be based on the excellent
textbook <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf">The
Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy</a> by Cynthia Dwork
and Aaron Roth.  For certain topics, we might also be using Salil
Vadhan's fantastic
survey <a href="http://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/files/privacytools/files/complexityprivacy_1.pdf">The
Complexity of Differential Privacy.</a>




<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your grade in the course will be based on a mix of work completed individually and that completed in cooperation with your reading and research group. This is a preliminary breakdown that may change during the term: </p>
<ul>
<li>2 Homeworks (10% each)</li>
<li>Attendance (15% total)</li>
<li>Participation (e.g., speaking up in class, participation in your reading and research group discussions) (5%)</li>
<li>Group research/reading project (10% for interim writeup; 30% for final writeup)</li>
<li>Project Presentation (20%)</li>
</ul>
