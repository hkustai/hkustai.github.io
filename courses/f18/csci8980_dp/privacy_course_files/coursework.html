<h2>Homeworks.</h2>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to collaborate with your classmates on homework problems, but each person must write up the final solutions individually. You should note on your homework specifically which problems were a collaborative effort and with whom. You may not search online for solutions, but if you do use research papers or other sources in your solutions, you must cite them.</p><br>


<h2>Course projects.</h2>
<p>
The course project can take two possible forms.
<ul>
<li>Reading project: Read and understand a paper (or several related
papers) not covered in class. Produce a write-up about the results,
that includes a rigorous, and concise presentation of the main result
of the paper.  Present the papers in class.  Group size no more than
2.</li>

<li>Research project: Work on a open-ended research problem, which can
be entirely empirical, or entirely theoretical, or anywhere in
between. Produce a write-up in the form of an academic paper that
clearly defines the problem, discusses related prior work, and
describes your findings.
</li>

</ul>
